# Xen for Neovim

This repository adds syntax highlighting support for Xen to Neovim.

## Installing

To install, simply run `install.sh`. This will create symlinks to the extension files in your Neovim config directory. That way any updates can simply be pulled from GitHub in this directory and Neovim will automatically register the changes the next time you run it. It'll also generate an uninstaller script you can run to uninstall the extension.
